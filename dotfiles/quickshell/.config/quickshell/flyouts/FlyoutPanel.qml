//
// Shared shell for every bar flyout: a full-screen, transparent,
// click-through-everywhere-except-the-box layer-shell surface. The
// full-screen size (rather than sizing to the box) is what makes
// "click anywhere else closes it" possible -- a MouseArea behind the
// box catches the click and closes the flyout; the box has its own
// MouseArea on top of that one, so clicks that land on the box itself
// don't reach the backdrop. The box itself is PanelFrame.qml.
