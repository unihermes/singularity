# Singularity design reference

The design decisions for the shell's UI, element by element. Read this before
changing or adding UI, so new pieces match what is already there. Values come
from `services/Theme.qml`; the look that sets them is `singularity` in
`services/Looks.js`.

The current design is **Channel** (settled 2026-10-01): grayscale, rounded,
double-lined, with one indigo accent (`#5555c8`) for marks.

## The channel

The signature shape. Every frame is three bands, outside in, then the ground:

| Band       | Colour            | Width            | Theme token          |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Outer line | muted `#4d4d4d`   | 1px              | `channelOuter`       |
| Groove     | base `#0b0b0b`    | 2px              | `channelGroove`      |
| Inner line | border `#303030`  | 1px              | `channelInner`       |
| Ground     | depends on element | —               | —                    |

- `channelWidth` (4px) is the first clear pixel inside the bands.
- A **lit** channel (open, on, focused, selected) turns the groove accent.
- Corners are rounded and concentric: each band's radius is the outer radius
  minus its inset.
- Draw it with `flyouts/Channel.qml`. A frame joined across shapes (a flyout
  grown from its bar group) uses `flyouts/GrownFrame.qml`, which builds the
  path with `services/ChannelPath.js`. Where widths change, inside corners get
  a fillet of `channelFillet` (7px). Edges closer than a corner's worth snap
  flush instead of leaving a sliver.

Setting: `frameStyle: "channel"`.

## Bar

- **Groups:** left, centre and right are each one channel around their visible
  modules (`moduleStyle: "grouped"`). The channel is `groupHeight`
  (bar height − 4) tall with radius `groupRadius` (radius + 4) and a surface
  ground. Drawn in `shell.qml` (`groupRect()`).
- **Modules** sit flush inside the inner line, with no frame of their own:
  - at rest: nothing
  - hover: overlay fill
  - open (its flyout is showing): overlay fill and a 2px accent ring
- **Level chips** (volume, brightness, battery) fill the **whole chip** from the
  left, in the level colour (accent2, green for battery). The icon is centred
  on top. Never show a level as an underline or thin rule.
- Icon-only, by design; no text readouts beside icons.

## Flyouts

- **Grown from the group** (`flyoutAttach: "grown"`): the flyout hangs straight
  off the bottom of the whole group its module sits in, with one channel
  outline around both. Rounded inside corners join them where the widths
  differ, and the sides are straight where they line up (at the screen edge,
  for instance). It only fades in, since its frame is joined to the bar.
- **Frame:** a channel with a surface ground and radius `channelPanelRadius`
  (13px).
- **Sectioned:** each run of rows between headings and dividers sits in its
  own channel (panel ground, radius + 3), in place of divider lines.
  `FlyoutPanel` works out the runs from the column's children. To start a new
  section, put a `FlyoutDivider` (or an item with `isSectionBreak: true`)
  **directly** in the flyout's column; a divider nested inside a sub-Column
  won't split the section.
- Content clears both frames: `padX` and `padY` in `FlyoutPanel`.

### Clock flyout

- **Tabs**, one shown at a time, picked from a segmented strip in its own
  section at the top: **Month**, **Today** (it reads **Day** once another day
  is picked) and **Timer** (it reads **Timer ●** while one runs).
- It opens on Today, or on Month when no calendar feeds are set up (then
  there's no Today tab).
- Picking a day in the month switches to that day's events.
- The Refresh row sits under the events, in its own section.
- Timer tab: the time large (`fontHero`) with what it is underneath, then the
  minute stepper and the chips.

## Settings pages

Pages are redesigned one at a time; a redesigned page sets
`sectioned: true` on its `SettingsPage`. Appearance is done so far.

- **Tabs:** one segmented strip at the top, an icon and a name per tab
  (names elide when tight), replacing the page heading and description.
- **Sections:** each group of rows between headings sits in its own channel
  (`SectionRuns`, as in the flyouts). Rows are inset to clear it.
- **Hints:** one line, eliding if needed. Write them short, at most about 44
  characters ("Frames, chips and dividers"), with no lists of every choice.
  The label column is wider (`fit(320)`).
- **Live preview (Appearance):** pinned above the rows on the Colours, Style,
  Text, Bar and Panels tabs. It shows a scaled-down bar and flyout built
  from the real components (`ModuleFrame`, `PanelFrame`, `FlyoutHeading`,
  `Slider`, …) over the wallpaper, so it follows every setting and can't
  drift from the shell. It's only built while one of those tabs shows.
- **Visual pickers:** a choice judged by eye (Frames, Shadows, Density)
  is a grid of tiles, four across. Each tile draws what its value does; the
  current one has the lit groove. Numbers stay steppers, and on/off stays a
  switch.
- **Look summary:** the look card with "See changes" appears on the Look
  tab only.

## Headings

- Bold spaced caps, value in white (`VOLUME  45%`).
- An accent `//` before each one, drawn a little lighter than the accent. It
  comes from the look's `heading.prefix`.
- A line from the end of the heading to the right edge (`headingRule`).
- In sectioned flyouts they get room above and below so the section frames
  clear them.

## Rows and selection

- **Hover:** overlay fill, with the text going white.
- **Selected or current:** a short 2px accent tick on the left edge, with the
  text going white. No fill, so it isn't mistaken for hover.
- Readout rows (`trailingIsValue`, `enabled: false`): grey label and white
  value.

## Controls (level-chip style)

Controls are small channels: an outer line plus a groove. They light the
groove, or fill with the accent, when active.

- **Switch:** no knob. When off it is a dark well with the inner line; when on
  it fills with the accent inside a dark groove.
- **Slider:** a 16px level chip. A dark groove holds an accent fill up to the
  value, with a thin white marker at the level.
- **Segmented:** a channel strip, `rowHeight` tall (taller than chips). The chosen segment fills with the accent
  inside a 2px dark groove, with white text.
- **Chip/button:** surface ground with an outer line and groove. Hover
  brightens the outer line, and selected fills with the accent. Armed
  (confirm-twice) is the alert fill.
- **Input:** surface ground with an outer line and groove; when focused, the
  groove turns into a 2px accent band.
- Read-only meters (`Meter.qml`) stay thin bars.

## Type

- UbuntuMono Nerd Font for everything: text and icons.
- **All text is bold** (`textWeight: "bold"`): UbuntuMono has no medium
  weight. Every Text takes `Theme.weightBody`; emphasis and headings use
  `Theme.weightStrong`. A new Text sets `font.weight: Theme.weightBody`, and
  a conditional emphasis is `font.weight: cond ? Theme.weightStrong :
  Theme.weightBody`, never `font.bold: cond`, which would drop the off state
  to regular.
- Sizes: body 16, headings 14, captions 12, and the bar's own size
  (`barFontSize`).

## Colour

- Grayscale ramp: base `#0b0b0b`, bar `#121212`, panel `#141414`, surface
  `#1a1a1a`, overlay `#242424`, border `#303030`, muted `#4d4d4d`, subtext
  `#7a7a7a`, text `#d0e2fa`, bright `#ebebeb`.
- Accent `#5555c8`, for marks only: selection, open and lit states, `//`.
- Good `#7d9b7d` and alert `#a87676`, desaturated on purpose.

## Wording and behaviour

These are carried over from the 2026-09-27 consistency sweep:

- **Case:** feature and page names in Title Case; action labels in sentence
  case.
- **Punctuation:** use "…" and "—".
- **Destructive actions** take two clicks (`confirm`, `confirmText`).
- **Booleans** are switches.
- Every flyout has an **empty state**.
- Device flyouts end with "More in Settings".

## Adding UI

- Reach for the shared components (`FlyoutRow`, `FlyoutHeading`,
  `FlyoutDivider`, `Switch`, `Slider`, `FlyoutSegmented`, `FlyoutChip`,
  `FlyoutInput`, `PanelFrame`, `Channel`) before drawing your own.
- **No hand-picked colours or sizes:** take every colour, size and duration from
  `Theme`. A control frames itself through `Theme.controlBorder()`,
  `Theme.controlStroke()` and `ControlEdge`, so it follows the frame style.
- **Mock first:** before building UI, make HTML mockups in the real look and let
  the user pick. When a choice is made, record it here.
