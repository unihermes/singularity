-- gestures:workspace_swipe, gestures:workspace_swipe_fingers,
-- dwindle:pseudotile and misc:vfr, plus `togglesplit`, which is a layout
-- message here rather than a dispatcher.

    -- /usr/lib/polkit-kde-authentication-agent-1, a KDE path that doesn't
    -- exist on this system, so the exec failed instantly and quietly and
    -- no agent ever ran -- any privileged action (mounting a drive, a
    -- NetworkManager prompt) would hang waiting on a dialog that could
