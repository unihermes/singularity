# Toggle between monocle (every tiled window maximized, one visible at a
# time) and plain dwindle tiling.
#
# Hyprland has no monocle layout -- it ships dwindle and master only -- so
# monocle is emulated: dwindle stays the underlying layout and a window rule
# maximizes every tiled window as it opens. Toggling the rule is what
# switches "layout".
#
# The rule's handle is a Lua global in hyprland.lua, reachable here because
# `hyprctl eval` shares the config's Lua state. (`hyprctl keyword` refuses to
# run at all under the Lua parser -- it answers "can't work with non-legacy
# parsers. Use eval.")
#
# A window rule only applies as a window opens, so toggling also fixes the
# window you're looking at. The rest settle as you alt-tab onto them.
#
# State lives in XDG_RUNTIME_DIR so it is cleared on reboot, which puts it
# back in step with the config's default of monocle. A mid-session
# `hyprctl reload` re-enables the rule and can desync it; toggling twice
# fixes that.
